# Docker Wars

## Overview
Docker Wars is a React App inside a docker container.
This docker image caches npm modules and only runs `npm install` when needed. You don't need to run it locally to be able to do dev work on this app.  

## Usage
To start the the dev environment, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), then run `docker-compose up --build` in the app root.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
