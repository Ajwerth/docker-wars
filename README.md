# Docker Wars

## Overview
Docker Wars is a React App inside a docker container. 

To start the the dev environment run `docker-compose up --build`.

This docker image caches npm modules and only runs `npm install` when needed. You don't need to run it locally to be able to do dev work on this app. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
